### Content
The tool that I decided on was [gDevelop](https://gdevelop.io/) because it's a very **versatile** tool that can be used to make all kinds of games.  
I tinkered with [gDevelop](https://gdevelop.io/) by making a _small game_ using what I learned from the [tutorials](https://editor.gdevelop.io/) the tool gave.  
So far, I've learned how to:  
* Add behaviors to objects.
* Add objects.
* Change the behavior of the **camera**.
* Add backgrounds.
* Make conditionals in the **events** section.
* Add **movement** to the character.
* Add **bullets**.
* Add a **timer**.
* Use _Javascript_ in the **events** page.

This is my [learning log](https://github.com/williaml4292/sep11-freedom-project/blob/main/tool/learning-log.md).

Using [gDevelop](https://gdevelop.io/), I plan to make a *platformer* game where the objective is to move the ball to the very end of the level.
#### Other tools I've considered:
* [Phaser](https://phaser.io/)
* [P5play](https://p5play.org/learn/)
* [ConvNetJS](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/convnetjs/)
### EDP
I am currently on the first step of the _Engineering Design Process_, which is to _Define the Problem_. I've already determined what I want to make, so all I have to do is to find out **how** to make it. My next step of the _EDP_ is to _Research the Problem_, which in this case, is to find out how to _make all the components_ necessary for my game.
### Skills
Two skills that I've developed thus far in *SEP 11* are **How to learn** and **How to read**.
#### How to learn
Similar to what happened in _SEP 10_, we have to learn about our tool in our free time.  In my case, it was very easy to learn the basics of [gDevelop](https://gdevelop.io/), mainly because there was a _built-in tutorial_ in the editor itself.  As long as we completed all the tutorial lessons, we would learn how to _add_ **objects**, **behaviors**, **backgrounds**, **movement** and much more. However, after all the tutorial lessons are completed, I would have to find videos online teaching me about the **2D phyics engine** _and maybe the 3D one too._ I would also have to find resources about _how to add a power system_ as movement.  
My takeaways? 
* Start from the **basics** to make everything else easier.
* **Ignore** all _complicated_ stuff until you mastered the basics as they take too long to understand without a comprehensive understanding of everything prior to it. 
#### How to Read
Back in SEP 10, I read absolutely everything in the [documentation of jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).  
Now, I realized that I wasted a lot of time doing that, as I rarely used anything other than `jekyll b`, `jekyll s`, and `jekyll new`.  
When learning about [gDevelop](https://gdevelop.io/), I barely even used the [documentation](https://wiki.gdevelop.io/gdevelop5/) and even when I did, I only searched up for _very specific things_ instead of reading through it **all**. I also stopped trying to completely understand everything that the tutorials said and just focused on how to **replicate** everything that happened in the tutorials. This allows me to use what I learned in the tutorials in future projects, even when I _cut down on the time used_ in each tutorial.  
This is significant because it allows me to use that time on _other_ things, not just the tutorials.
