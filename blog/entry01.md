### Content
The tool that I decided on was [gDevelop](https://gdevelop.io/) because it's a very **versatile** tool that can be used to make all kinds of games.  
I tinkered with [gDevelop](https://gdevelop.io/) by making a _small game_ using what I learned from the [tutorials](https://editor.gdevelop.io/) the tool gave.  
So far, I've learned how to:  
* Add behaviors to objects.
* Add objects.
* Change the behavior of the **camera**.
* Add backgrounds.
* Make conditionals in the **events** section.
* Add **movement** to the character.
* Add **bullets**.
* Add a **timer**.
* Use _Javascript_ in the **events** page.

This is my [learning log](https://github.com/williaml4292/sep11-freedom-project/blob/main/tool/learning-log.md).

Using [gDevelop](https://gdevelop.io/), I plan to make a *platformer* game where the objective is to move the ball to the very end of the level.
#### Other tools I've considered:
* [Phaser](https://phaser.io/)
* [P5play](https://p5play.org/learn/)
* [ConvNetJS](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/convnetjs/)
