# Entry 2
##### 12/18/25

### Content
After the previous entry, I've been _trying new events within the events page_ and using _videos_ to learn how to create movement.  
So far, I've learned how to _create and use text with **variables**_ and made a _basic movement system_ that **could be used** for my game.
