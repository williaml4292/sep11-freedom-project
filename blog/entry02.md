# Entry 2

### Content
After the previous entry, I've been _trying new events within the events page_ and using _videos_ to learn how to create movement.  
So far, I've learned how to _create and use text with **variables**_ and I made a _basic movement system_ that **could be used** for my game.  
To add text in [gDevelop](https://editor.gdevelop.io/), you have to _change the value_ of the variable via javascript or making it an action in the events page. _Every time_ the text changes, you have to **update** it.  
I learned how to use text in [gDevelop](https://editor.gdevelop.io/) by reading through [this post](https://forum.gdevelop.io/t/using-a-text-object-to-display-a-variable/27967/3).  
An example of using text:

I also learned how to make the player move **using the mouse without allowing them to drag the player across the level**.  
I learned this in [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2k1Lkld6fk).  
The basic code is as follows:

My FP goal for the winter break is to, hopefully, have enough time to **finish** the movement tutorial and **experiment** with it,
while also finishing the work from other classes so that I can dedicate the rest of my lunch periods (in this semester) to learning this tool.
